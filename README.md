# Traffic Analysis of Fluctuating Flows (TAFFy)

## About

Network and security operators are continually bombarded by strange
deviations in network traffic that are sometimes operationally
problematic, sometimes a threat to security, and other times just
plain odd.  Wouldn't it be wonderful to have a tool that accurately
tells you exactly what has changed in these traffic profiles?
This tool is designed to do just that.

## Installation

    pip install traffic-taffy

## Usage

See the online [readthedocs
documentation](https://traffic-taffy.readthedocs.io/).

## Development

Traffic-taffy is under very rapid development with a fair amount of
refactoring as time goes on into better class architectures.  If you
are considering looking at portions of the code and submitting pull
requests, please reach out to Wes ahead of time to check what changes
might be coming that will cause merge conflicts.
